# 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing

This project introduces learners to Bash control flow structures, including loops, conditional statements, and input parsing. By completing these tasks, you will gain foundational scripting skills that allow you to automate tasks, handle decisions, and manipulate data effectively in shell scripts.

---

## 📁 Project Setup

**Repository:** `system_engineering-devops`
**Directory:** `0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing`

All scripts must:

* Start with the shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* Include a descriptive comment on the second line
* Have executable permissions
* Use the required loop/conditional structure specified in each task

## 📝 Tasks Overview

### **0. For Best School Loop — `1-for_best_school`**

Write a script that prints **“Best School” 10 times** using a **for loop**.
**Restrictions:** while and until loops are forbidden.

---

### **1. While Best School Loop — `2-while_best_school`**

Print **“Best School” 10 times** using a **while loop**.
**Restrictions:** for and until loops are forbidden.

---

### **2. Until Best School Loop — `3-until_best_school`**

Print **“Best School” 10 times** using an **until loop**.
**Restrictions:** for and while loops are forbidden.

---

### **3. If 9, Say Hi! — `4-if_9_say_hi`**

Within a while loop printing “Best School” 10 times, print **“Hi”** immediately after the **9th iteration** using an **if statement**.

---

### **4. 4 Bad Luck, 8 Is Your Chance — `5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance`**

Loop from 1 to 10 using a while loop and:

* Print **“bad luck”** on iteration 4

### **7. To file, or not to file — `9-to_file_or_not_to_file`**

Check whether a file named **school** exists, and if so:

* Whether it is empty or not
* Whether it is a regular file
  Uses **if / else** only.

---

## 🚀 Submission

* Ensure all scripts are in the `0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing` directory.
* Filenames must match exactly.
* Upload to GitHub via UI or git.
* Auto-checker will validate correctness at the end of the deadline.

---

## ✔ Requirements Recap

* Correct shebang
* Second-line comment
